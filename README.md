# Raw materials analysis:

## What raw materials and resources are finite?
All raw materials used daily are finites, coming from minary, extraction, deforestation, etc. At the rythn of population growth and the rise in the demand of new technology,  how long these resources will last? 


In this analysis, IÂ´ve made a research of the minerals in terms of import and exports, prices... etc. 

To find the right data, strong search of the commodity has ended up being the following, the main webpage that information was useful:
- Yearly and monthly reports from www.usgs.gov, USA government has open data on global production.
- The trade of commodities has been download from here the World integrated trade solution. wits.worldbank.org
- Reports on CO2 and demand of minerals in  from www.iea.org
- Prices historical from www.investing.com


Final project of Ironhack bootcamp where I am looking to make a full analysis of a data research theme.
