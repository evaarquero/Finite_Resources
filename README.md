# Raw materials analysis:
In the moment of looking at a more sustainable future, we are making an investment and an idea based on the use of technology, such as electrical vehicles and renweable energy to succeed in this sustainability. BUT!, what happen when the raw materials for these technologies are finite? or very difficult to mine? or even extracting the materials generates a high pollution?  


In this analysis, IÂ´ve made a research of the minerals in terms of import and exports, prices... etc. 

To find the right data, strong search of the commodity has ended up being the following, the main webpage that information was useful:
- To understand the high risk minerals for supply chain: https://rmis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/uploads/CRMs_for_Strategic_Technologies_and_Sectors_in_the_EU_2020.pdf

- Yearly and monthly reports from www.usgs.gov, USA government has open data on global production.
- The trade of commodities has been download from here the World integrated trade solution. wits.worldbank.org
- Reports on CO2 and demand of minerals in  from www.iea.org
- Prices historical from www.investing.com

The risk supply for the new technologies happens with different materials.

In my research I focused on Magnesium and Cobalt.

Magnesium is used in vehicles as aluminium alloy, the extraction has been stopped in China to control de CO2 emissions, putting in risk all supply for these technologies.

Cobalt is used in lithium-ion batteries, commonly in all electric technologies as smarphones, EV or laptops. Cobalt minnery is mainly in the democratic replublic of Congo, where even domestic is used to extract this mineral. The extraction of Cobalt is connected to conflict, child laboury or corruption in Congo. 




Final project of Ironhack bootcamp where I am looking to make a full analysis of a data research topic.

# NEXT STEPS:
## What raw materials and resources are finite?
All raw materials used daily are finites, coming from minary, extraction, deforestation, etc. At the rythn of population growth and the rise in the demand of new technology,  how long these resources will last?
